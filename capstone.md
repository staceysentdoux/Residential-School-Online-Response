## How Google Trends can illuminate who is talking about residential schools, where they are, how they're searching, and why.

### Introduction:

** It is important to note that this is an extension of Ryan Pickering's project, just edited as well as looking at data several years later. **

"The Indian residential school system is one of the most heinous parts of Canada's history and is an ongoing injustice for Indigenous people across Canada. While a government apology and ongoing Truth and Reconciliation Commission have begun to heal the wounds that began over one hundred years ago, Canada still has a lot to answer for and reflect upon. When considering the attempted cultural genocide of Canadian Indigenous people throughout the 20th century through residential school, there is never a time to stop considering this.

This project grew out of a desire to discover how people were thinking about the residential schools in the last several years, with developments like Stephen Harper's apology in 2008 and the ongoing Truth and Reconciliation Commission. I wanted to learn if Canadians were considering the legacy of residential schools or if it was being ignored in the everyday experiences of Canadians. I have not uncovered any objective answers, but what I have discovered is illuminating nonetheless.

Through analyzing search patterns on Google Trends about residential schools, I believe I have uncovered some interesting patterns and trends in how people use Google, the most prevalent search engine of the Internet, to look for knowledge about residential schools. By looking at when searching is going on, where it is happening, and how residential schools are being searched, I believe that I have discovered who is searching for residential schools primarily and why. Trends that seem both obvious and unusual are viewable, and indeed there are some trends that I am unable to understand, and hopefully another historian can discover further patterns and trends about residential schools and the general population."

### Methodology: 

** This will also replicate Ryan's methods in sourcing out the data from Google Trends **

"In beginning to look at the public consciousness of Canada regarding the residential school system, I took to examining Google Trends to see how people search for residential schools. I mainly used the feature that compares search terms over a period of time, as well as comparing frequencies of terms over the provinces and major cities of Canada.

Google Trends' techniques used to create the numbers that make up their visualizations are complicated, and they do not allow the user to see raw numbers. Instead, their Help section states that "Google Trends analyzes a percentage of Google web searches to determine how many searches have been done for the terms you've entered compared to the total number of Google searches done during that time." (Google, 2015) Additionally, how they normalize their data so that it is usable across large areas is they divide it by the number of total searches. Despite unequal populations in provinces, search frequencies generally mean the same thing due to their being a percentage of searches. However, what is represented as 100 on one of the figures below does not mean that searches on residential schools were the only searches done on Google for that month. Instead, whatever time period or region has the highest relative amount of searches on a topic is represented as 100, and other regions or time periods are represented relative to that 100.

With all of that said, at various points in the site I will allude to these normalization strategies Google uses in order to remind the reader that these values are all relative and do not reflect objective numbers at this point. This has become a major part of this project - all of these numbers are relative, and thus a great deal of subjective interpretation must be used on these figures to root them in some sort of reality. Because of this, I have taken the liberty of interpreting these figures and numbers according to my subjective opinions and experiences. I do not believe that this takes away from the material, but instead allows for other historians to use this material and use other sources to illuminate aspects I may gloss over. History is oftentimes more of an art than a science, and my methodology in subjective interpretation reflects this."


### Timeline: 
![alt text](https://github.com/staceysentdoux/Residential-School-Online-Response/blob/master/timeline%20.png?raw=true)


##### Ryan's findings: 
"The first thing that needs to be discussed is who is searching for residential schools: with close examination of this graph and some basic inference, we can discover that fairly easily. Looking at this timeline, one can see there is a general fluctuation in search patterns from 2004 to the present: there may be a rise in discussion of residential schools for the better part of a year, but there are numerous dips within each year. While the search activity from year to year can differ, these periods of search inactivity persist.

If one mouses over the lower portions of the graph, the months they represent are July, August, January and December. Furthermore, the dips in July and August are significantly larger than those during January and December. These dates correspond to the Canadian public school schedule, with two months off in the summer (July and August) and several weeks off for Christmas and New Years (December and January). It is clear to see that the people who are searching the most for residential schools on Google are students!

What can we draw from this then, on a historical basis? We can assume that student assignments based around residential schools are part of the curriculum and therefore not entirely dependent on political events, such as Harper's apology or the TRC (Truth and Reconciliation Commission). While Harper's apology does make a spike in search frequency, if one looks to June of 2008, or discussion of compensation, if one looks at November of 2004 or 2005, searches are still made during the year on a schedule that is largely consistent with the school year. This latter discussion of compensation may not be linked to the search frequencies in these periods at all: instead, it may be the time of year that teachers generally introduce discussion of residential schools. This would be consistent with the general pattern of discussion on residential schools peaking in November and March or April respectively, both of which are in the middle of each half of the school year."

###### Current Findings: 
The data suggests that Ryan's findings were similar, even several years later. There is an increase during the months of May/June and then again in October/November, typically during the time of the school year where projects are due. This once again reinforces Ryan's idea that students are the majority of those who are searching the term Residential Schools on Google. I myself could have been one of those students during the years of 2010 to 2016, where I was enrolled in Canadian History or Studies classes in both high school and university. 

### Regions: 

![alt text](https://github.com/staceysentdoux/Residential-School-Online-Response/blob/master/region%20.png?raw=true)


For this portion, since Ryan's findings were blocked off by the images, it was difficult to read what his analysis was. From the current findings, the top three regions where interest was high were, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta respectively. In these three regions, is where we find the population of Indigenous Peoples to be relatively higher than British Columbia and Ontario. This could be an indication of why the interest is much higher in the Mid-Western/Prairie regions. 


### Semantics:

##### Current Findings: 
For this part, once again part of Ryan's analysis was blocked out by images of the graphs. However, the data is still very similar in the current findings, where Saskatchewan and Manitoba were the two regions where the interest for Indian Residential Schools and Canada Residential Schools were high. Additionally, those two regions had close to no searches for Aboriginal Residential Schools, which could re-emphasize how racist these regions can be, by using a term that Indigenous Peoples find offensive.

##### Ryan's Findings: 

In Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the terms most used, aside from the simple residential schools, are are "indian residential schools" and "canada residential schools." In Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia, the most frequent terms are "canadian residential schools," and to a lesser degree, "aboriginal residential schools." That last term has a frequency of 100 in Manitoba, which is interesting. This is a lot of variance in the terms across the country... what could this possibly mean?

There are many possibilities for what these semantic differences might signify. This project will not examine outside factors on these and instead will speculate in order to allow other historians or sociologists to explore this.

There are two possibilities I have conceived of for the difference between "indian residential schools" and "aboriginal residential schools." One, the use of the term Indian might represent the presence of systemic racism in Saskatchewan, as opposed to the more progressive and appropriate term Aboriginals being used in other parts of the country. However, that explanation disregards some important factors. For example, if systemic racism was affecting search history in one of the prairie provinces like this, it does not make sense that the trend would not be reflected in Manitoba as well, where the capital city was called out by Macleans magazine as the most racist city in the country.

Instead, perhaps an explanation could be that education focuses on the legacy and history of residential schools more in Saskatchewan. It is true that the official title of the residential schools is Indian Residential Schools - and there is no such thing as an Aboriginal residential school. Thus, one could see an overcompensation of politically correct discussion in other provinces, assuming the term Indian is inappropriate in all contexts, even when referring to past institutions like the residential schools. While this does not give any real answers, highlighting these strange semantic differences illuminates possibilities for further historical scholarship on residential schools and public consciousness.

One idea I have towards the divide between "canada residential schools" and "canadian residential schools," additionally, is a conception of the nature of residential schools. Contrary to the idea of Saskatchewan using proper terminology as just discussed, the use of the word Canadian in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia could represent a fuller engagement the provinces have with discourses of residential schools and their legacy. The use of the word Canadian can signify a recognition of the fact that these schools are Canadian, and are an essential part of our national story. Conversely, in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, just the use of Canada while searching for residential schools could represent instead a lack of recognition that these schools were a venture supported and run by the Canadian government. They might see them as something that happened in Canada, as opposed to something Canadian.

### Conclusion: 

Despite this data analysis being replicated several years later, we are still finding the results to be the same. Where it seems to be mainly students who are searching, and in places where there is a larger population of Indigenous Peoples, and how the different search terms are varied from region to region. Could this be another wake up call, that nothing has changed over the years? Do we not sympathize or feel remorse for our actions to the Indigenous communities, unless it is school related? Thus, I agree with Ryan's conclusion as follows. 


##### Ryan's Conclusion: 

1. Due to the dispersion of searches across a year, it is mostly students who are searching about residential schools, most likely for school assignments.
2. There are more searches for residential schools in areas with higher Indigenous populations. This is true across provinces and across cities.
3. Semantic differences in search terms can possibly be accounted for through different conceptions of residential schools by province, most likely due to the educational system teaching accuracy versus political correctness.

These discoveries are not neutral: they are based in subjectivity and rooted in relative figures. But they do form a framework of thought on which historians can begin to further study historical consciousness of Canadians towards residential schools.

What does show through here, though, is that Canadians need to engage with discussions around residential schools more than they do now, especially outside of the prairies, where discourse around Indigenous issues is developing with the large populations of Indigenous people there. Discourse cannot be limited to students Googling facts for assignments and those who live in areas with high percentages of Indigenous people residing. Canadians who live in central and eastern Canada have to consider their own historical complicity in the residential school system, despite the prevalence of the western provinces in being aware of this sad history.
