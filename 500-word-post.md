Where do I begin when it comes to my journey and development as a historian over the last six weeks? It has not been the best journey and is indeed comparable to a roller coaster. With the many downs and occasional ups, plus the stress of my health and family issues, it has definitely been an interesting summer term so far. The terrible weather does not help either! When I began this class, the first 'getting started' module seemed simple enough to follow, but I was then met with several obstacles as the weeks went by. Since I have been suffering from a concussion, the amount of screen time plus the stress of not being able to get through the exercises really was an extremely difficult time for me. However, I did not let that discourage me from starting fresh and with an open mind for the following weeks or modules. The ability to reach out on Slack and hear back from either my peers or our TA, or our professor himself was extremely helpful, and made me feel like I was not alone.

It was also super interesting to read blog posts from various historians as part of our required readings. Not only is it a thousand times better than typical academic readings that can usually be boring, but it was more personable to read their experiences, advice or thoughts on the various topics discussed in this course. Additionally, having the ability to annotate and have discussions or replies with my peers on the readings is an excellent tool. For example, in one of the readings, the author talked about how the human mind often reads over and misses terms pretty easily as compared to a machine. I annotated and said that I had once seen a post or watched a video where it was a challenge to see how many of the same words you can count or something like that but could not recall what it was specifically. Almost a day later, one of my peers had responded telling me it was something along the lines of "how many F's can you count in this sentence". That was amazing to be able to connect with peers in the class through an online course, especially since for half of this course I have been in Singapore dealing with my late father's estate. 

While completing the capstone exercise, I had noticed how much I had learnt from this course, despite having troubles during the modules. For example, I have now managed to learn how to successfully utilize Dillinger for Markdown documents, eventhough I had trouble saving some of my fail logs as .md in the first few weeks! Whilst conducting the research to mimic Ryan's work, I felt that I actually sort of knew what I was doing. To me that is a large improvement in comparison to the stress and discouragement I felt in the beginning of this course. Of course I am still not at a level 5 or higher yet, I think growing from a level 0 to a level 3 or 4 skill level for this class is commendable nonetheless. I am proud of myself for being able to continue to strive despite the shortcomings I faced in parts of this course. I want to thank Professor Graham as well as our TA Ruth, for having patience and continuing to encourage me to strive for better.
